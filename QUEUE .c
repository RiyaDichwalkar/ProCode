/*Consider a single queueing system for a food joint. There is a single queue of customers.
The customers however, are served by three different counters. The moment a counter is
free, the first customer in the queue is serviced at the counter. It is possible that at a
particular time instant only 2 counters are free to serve customers, so at that point the first
2 customers are removed from the queue for servicing. Simulate this systemâ€™s behavior.
Your program must:
i. Create a queue for n customers
ii. At every instant of time ask for how many counters are free(k) and then remove
k customers from the queue accordingly. (Do this till all n customers are serviced.
Assume: There are no new customers adding to the queue.)
iii. Display the queue contents at each instant after removing customer*/
